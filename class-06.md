# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM.

An object is essentially a group of data that is alike - it can be things like variables and functions.

An advantage of object literals is that with an object literal you can send data over in a much easier, precise way. If your data isn't in an object literal then the chances are you have a lot of data which could lead to:
a) saving a lot of time sending over objects
b) it is easier to work with arrays
c) less likely to make mistakes with less code


How do objects differ from arrays?
Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
