## Ordered and Unordered lists
# People often use unordered lists in their HTML documents around items that do not need numerical ordering.
# Using an ordered list of course creates a numerical list determiend by the user.
# You can change the bullet style for an unordered list by adding an attribute e.g. circle, disc which changes the appearance.
# Determining when the use either unordered or ordered you need to determine whether each part of the list is meaningful, if it is then you must use ordered if not use unordered.

## The story of Ms Margin and Mr Padding - The Box Model Chronicles.
# In a town called WebDev there lived many people but 2 of whom were extra ordinary. A new piece of land became available to buy in which
# both Ms Margin and Mr Padding showed great interest. When they both arrived to view it, Ms Padding was really focused on the outside of the land whereas
# Mr Padding was focused on the inside of the land.
# They didn't get on and their views - though hypothetically work together - would clash each time.
# The landowner decided to sell to another person instead, Miss Console.

## Arrays, Operators and Expressions, Conditionals and Loops.
# Inside of an array, you can store data types such as strings, objects, numbers and even other arrays!
# const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];
# If we type console.log(people) and hit enter - we will get the results from this array.
# 5 shorthand operators could be:
# +=
# -=
# x=
# /=
# The top one = (Add and Assign): The += operator adds the value on the right to the current value of the variable on the left and assigns the result back to the variable.
#  let a = 10;
# let b = 'dog';
# let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;

 # So this is where we are adding numbers to booleans then concatenating the result with a string?
 # With that logic, (a+c) is 10 + false and when run becomes 0. So 10 + 0 = 10.
 # Then we add b which is dog. So it becomes 10dog lol.
