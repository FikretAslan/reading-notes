# Readings: Basics of HTML, CSS & JS.

## HTML continued

### Semantic elements/tags are important within websites because they allow search engines and other devices to determine the importance and context of web pages. They also enable the pages to read much easier as it is more accessible.

### There are 6 levels of headings. <h1> being used ONCE and <h2>-<h6> as many times as the user requests.

### The <sub> tag defines the subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.

### when using <abbr> you must follow it with a title - each <abbr> is independent!


## CSS structure

### There are so many different ways we can apply CSS to HTML. We change the font family & size, we can position the text to where we want it. We can add image slideshows (with help from JS). There are so many possibilities and we are only scratching the surface.

### The reason why it is considered bad practice to use 'inline styling' is because inline styles only affect the tag they are written in which can make making changes difficult as you go on.

### In this example the h2 is the selector and that tells the user what will change. The color and padding are properties of CSS as they will change and the declarations are the code within } and ;.


## JavaScript Continued

### The data type that is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks is a string.
### There are many types of operators developers use in JavaScript, some include:
- Arithmetic operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Assignment operators

### A real world problem that a function could solve could perhaps be someone trying to gain access to a building but as they are not a member the gate is declining their entry.

### An if statement checks a true and if it evaulates to true, then the code block will execute.
### People use else if when they want to test a new condition.
### Some comparison operators are:
- <(less than)
- >(greater than)
- <= (less than or equal to)
- >= (greater than or equal to)

### && is used to perform and operation means if anyone of the expression/condition evaluates to false whole thing is false. || is used to perform or operation if anyone of the expression/condition evaluates to true whole thing becomes true.
