## Growth Mindset ðŸŒ»

Growth mindset is a concept instilled in people from a primary school age. It is the understanding that people, through perseverance and determination, can continue to develop their knowledge and understanding.

## How will I use growth mindset throughout this course and beyond?

I will tell myself:
- if I haven't understood straight away, I will allow myself time to grasp it
- if things become overwhelming, I will give myself space and come back to it
- I will only better myself if I put the work in!

## A little about me ðŸ“·

I was an experienced primary school teacher and recently left to pursue my passion for coding & software development.
I'm 31 years old and I live in Cambridge. I enjoy video games, travelling, photography and cooking!
