# Markdown: An easy way for you to be an online creative!


# What is Markdown?

<p>Markdown is a simple way to make your plain text documents look nicer. Instead of using a fancy editor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you use special symbols to tell the computer how to format your text. For example, if you want a large title, you put a "#" symbol in front of it (like "# About Me"). If you want to make something bold, you use two asterisks before and after the text (like**this**text**is**bold**). It might seem a bit strange at first, especially if you're used to fancy editors, but Markdown is a popular way to format text without all the buttons and menus.</p>
