# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple way to make your plain text documents look nicer. Instead of using a fancy editor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you use special symbols to tell the computer how to format your text. For example, if you want a large title, you put a "#" symbol in front of it (like "# About Me").

If you want to make something bold, you use two asterisks before and after the text (**like this text is bold**). It is considered good practice to use the asterisks rather than the underscore __like this__ (which also works but can come across problems when accessed in different ways).
It might seem a bit strange at first, especially if you're used to fancy editors, but Markdown is a popular way to format text without all the buttons and menus.

# Why use Markdown?

People like to use Markdown instead of fancy text editors for a few good reasons:

- Versatility: Markdown can be used for lots of things like making websites, writing documents, taking notes, creating books, making presentations, sending emails and more.

- Compatibility: Markdown files can be opened on almost any computer or app. If you don't like the Markdown app you're using, you can switch to another one without losing your work.

- Works Everywhere: Markdown works on any device with any operating system. You can write Markdown on your computer, tablet, or phone, no matter what type they are.

- Widespread: Many websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of apps, both on your computer and online, know how to handle it. So, you'll find Markdown almost everywhere on the internet.
