# CSS Layout
*Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

What this means is it only deals with layout in a single direction - columns or rows - at a time, which can lead to particular customisation through CSS.


*Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

Flex items move as a group on the main axis. Remember: we've got a bunch of things and we are trying to get the best layout for them as a group.
You can do two things on the cross axis. You can move the items individually or as a group, so they align against each other and the flex container.


*How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

You should be cautious when using any properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document, as it can negatively impact accessibility.
