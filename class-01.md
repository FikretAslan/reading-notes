# Poem

## The browser, in all it's glory, sends an HTTP request message to the ever-growing and ever-knowing server,
## Asking it to send a copy of the website to the client, how bizzare?
## The TCP/IP is needed for the messages and data to be sent across - alas.

## The opening tag: begins the name of the element e.g. <p>
## The content: this is the content within the element e.g. <p> Hello
## The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except it includes a forward slash before the element name indicating the end e.g. <p>Hello</p>

# Attributes

## Elements can also have attributes nested in them.
e.g.

## Attributes contain extra information about the element - this however won't appear in the content.
## An attribute should have:
- A space between it and the element name.
- The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
- An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.

## More attributes include:
- <a> followed by href, title and target.

# Meta data tag

## Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a page's content; the meta tags don't appear on the page itself, but only in the page's source code.
