# Poem

### The browser, in all it's glory, sends an HTTP request message to the ever-growing and ever-knowing server,
### Asking it to send a copy of the website to the client, how bizzare?
### The TCP/IP is needed for the messages and data to be sent across - alas.

# Introduction to HTML

### The opening tag: begins the name of the element e.g. <p>
### The content: this is the content within the element e.g. <p> Hello
### The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except it includes a forward slash before the element name indicating the end e.g. <p>Hello</p>

# Attributes

### Elements can also have attributes nested in them.
e.g.

### Attributes contain extra information about the element - this however won't appear in the content.
### An attribute should have:
- A space between it and the element name.
- The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
- An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.

### More attributes include:
- <a> followed by href, title and target.

# Meta data tag

### Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a page's content; the meta tags don't appear on the page itself, but only in the page's source code.

# Miscellaneous

## So how does one design a website?

### First and foremost, you need a goal and a vision. Without these it could lead to your project being only a fantasy or incomplete. Think about what you want to accomplish, what needs to be done and how.

## Semantics
### The reason why developers may choose to use <h1> over <span> is because h1 already has things like font-weight attached to it which shows right away as opposed to being coded on CSS.

## JavaScript

### We need JavaScript within HTML and CSS because it can store important variables, it can perform operations and functions and can run code in response to certain events occuring on a web page.
