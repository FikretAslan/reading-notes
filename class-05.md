# HTML Media

A real world situation in which the alt attribute could be used is when people use e-readers to get all the information about an image on the page.
Adding effective alternative text, or 'alt text', to your images increases the accessibility of your digital images.
By including alt text, you can make sure that your images meet accessibility standards.
The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
When using a GIF it is important to remember that when you stretch it length or width ways it'll pixelate the image. The SVG however is scaleable
and resolution-independent will look crispier on any screen resolution.

# Learn CSS

Foreground may refer to font colors or it is the colors of objects in the screen except the background.
Foreground colors(colors which are before background colours) are the colours you see on the screen before the background colours.
I would first of all inspect the HTML and CSS and see what is already there. I would firstly change the background colour to a darker colour,
(as everyone prefers dark theme) this then means I would need to change the color (which affects the font colour). I would also see if any of the divs need
border colours and if it needs a background colour.
