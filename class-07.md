# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

# Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.
An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

# HTML Table Basics

HTML tables should be used for tabular data â€” this is what they are designed for.
Unfortunately, a lot of people used to use HTML tables to lay out web pages, e.g. one row to contain the header, one row to contain the content columns, one row to contain the footer, etc.

- <td> = Table Data
- <tr> = Table row
- <th> = table header

# Introducing Constructors

Constructors are used to initialize the objects of the class with initial values. Constructors are invoked automatically when the objects are created. Constructors can have default parameters.

Objects created using object literal are singletons, this means when a change is made to the object, it affects the object entire the script.
Whereas if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made to it, that change won't affect the object throughout the script
