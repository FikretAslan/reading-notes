## Readings: HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## HTML
To create a link you must wrap it around the  <a> element - usually looks something like: <a href. The href targets the url and is needed
for a user to follow a link somewhere else.
Why create accessible links?
- Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.
- Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.
-Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links.
 They will find descriptive link text useful.

## CSS

Normal flow: Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.
The flow is essentially a set of things that are all working together and know about each other in your layout.
Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.
Static is always default.
